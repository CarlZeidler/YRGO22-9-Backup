Standard measurment
Legend: tile, unit, unity meter; they're all the same 

Corridors should be 6 tiles high, this is the space inbetween the ceiling tile and floor tile. 
The player is currently 3 tiles high and can jump about 6 tiles. 

Verticle/falling corridors should also be 6 tiles wide. 
Doors should also be 6 tiles high. This will allow them to cover both verticle and horizontal corridors.
